I'm Mikołaj Mikołajczyk, a seasoned DevOps engineer with a passion for both cutting-edge technology and nostalgic computing. My professional journey began in 2014 as a WordPress developer, where I honed my skills in web development. From there, I transitioned to administering Linux-based machines at the Office for Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices, and Biocidal Products.

My career path then led me to Citibank, where I managed various Unix-based systems and developed in-house tools to automate change management processes. Seeking new challenges, I joined Samsung as a DevOps engineer, contributing to their Private Cloud DNS project, akin to AWS Route53. Currently, I work at Inetum Poland, serving a client from Cumulocity GmbH, where I engage in innovative IoT projects.

Daily, I immerse myself in Kubernetes-based projects, leveraging a tech stack that includes Java, Golang, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub, and GitHub Actions. Beyond my professional endeavors, I have a deep-rooted interest in retro computing. I enjoy tinkering with retro-inspired machines like the Agon Light and Commander X16, reliving the charm of vintage technology.

This blog serves as a platform to share my insights, tips, and code snippets, ranging from DevOps practices to developing software for old computers. Join me as I navigate the realms of modern IT and retro computing, blending the best of both worlds.
